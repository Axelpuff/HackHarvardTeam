# Feature Specification: AI Schedule Counseling Conversational Assistant

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-ai`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an AI schedule counseling application that improves a user's schedule. The core interaction is a back-and-forth out-loud dialog with a conversational AI. The user states their problem or desired change (e.g. 'My Tuesdays are too hectic,' 'I'm not getting enough sleep'), and the AI considers their events and asks questions to gain more insight until it can propose a new schedule. The user's current schedule (a week or a day depending on their focus) is displayed in one panel, while the proposed schedule is shown in a second panel. A third panel shows an impersonal visual representation of the AI and a transcript. The schedule syncs to and from Google Calendar."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An individual user wants help improving their personal schedule (day or week). They open the application, see their current schedule imported from Google Calendar, voice a concern such as "My Tuesdays are too hectic" or "I'm not getting enough sleep." The system engages them in a spoken back‚Äëand‚Äëforth dialog, asking clarifying questions (e.g., "Which Tuesday activities feel least essential?" or "What time do you currently go to bed?"). After enough clarification, the system presents a proposed adjusted schedule side‚Äëby‚Äëside with the current one. The user can iterate by approving, rejecting particular changes, or requesting modifications ("Move the workout earlier", "Protect 8 hours of sleep"). Once satisfied, the user approves and the proposed schedule changes can be synced back to Google Calendar.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user with a connected Google Calendar and a displayed current weekly schedule, **When** they state a scheduling problem verbally (e.g., "My Tuesdays are too hectic"), **Then** the system MUST acknowledge the concern verbally/textually and ask at least one clarifying question referencing existing events.
2. **Given** the user has answered clarifying questions, **When** the system has sufficient information, **Then** it MUST produce a proposed schedule variant showing modifications (additions, removals, moves, or time adjustments) in a separate panel without altering the original schedule yet.
3. **Given** a proposed schedule is displayed, **When** the user requests a targeted change ("Shift my run to mornings"), **Then** the proposal MUST update to reflect the requested adjustment while preserving unrelated prior accepted adjustments.
4. **Given** the user approves the proposal, **When** they confirm finalization, **Then** the system MUST sync the approved changes to Google Calendar (creating, deleting, or updating events) and visually mark the proposal as applied.
5. **Given** network or calendar API failure occurs during sync, **When** the user attempts to apply changes, **Then** the system MUST notify the user of the failure and leave original calendar data untouched.
6. **Given** the user focuses on a single day view, **When** they express a broad weekly concern ("I want more balance across the week"), **Then** the system MUST prompt whether to switch to week context or proceed with day‚Äëonly adjustments. 

### Edge Cases
- User provides an extremely vague problem ("Make it better"): system asks for clarification and does not generate a proposal until at least one concrete constraint or goal is captured. 
- User rejects multiple consecutive proposals: system summarizes what has been tried and asks for new constraints to reduce iteration fatigue.
- Calendar has overlapping or duplicate events: system flags conflicts and may propose resolving overlaps before broader optimization. 
- User revokes Google Calendar permission mid‚Äësession: system halts further sync proposals and clearly indicates that changes cannot be applied until reconnected. 
- Long periods with no events (e.g., open afternoons): system asks whether to preserve open time or fill with suggested wellness/rest activities [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should system proactively suggest new event categories?].
- User expresses sleep concern but no sleep events exist: system asks typical sleep schedule and desired target before proposing changes. 
- Time zone change between sessions: system confirms intended time zone context before applying shifts [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Time zone handling policy].

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST ingest and display the user's current schedule (day and week views) sourced from Google Calendar without modifying events on initial load.
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable a user to articulate a scheduling problem or goal via spoken input and capture a transcript.
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate at least one clarifying question when the initial problem statement lacks actionable parameters (e.g., intensity, time constraints, goals).
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain an iterative dialog history transcript visible in the third panel.
- **FR-005**: System MUST produce a proposed schedule that highlights differences from the current schedule (e.g., moved events, added blocks, removed events) without committing changes.
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow the user to request modifications to the proposal using natural language (e.g., "Move the workout to 7 AM"), updating the proposal accordingly.
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow selective acceptance or rejection of individual proposed changes before final approval [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Granular accept per event vs whole proposal].
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow the user to approve the complete proposed schedule, triggering synchronization of changes back to Google Calendar.
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle sync operations atomically per event: failed updates must not partially corrupt unaffected events and must report which failed.
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide summary rationale for each proposed change (e.g., "Moved Lunch earlier to ensure 8-hour sleep window").
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow user to switch context between day view and week view; proposals must reflect the currently active context.
- **FR-012**: System MUST warn the user before discarding an in-progress proposal when switching context or starting a new problem statement.
- **FR-013**: System MUST support undo of last applied proposal within the current session [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Undo time scope, persistence across sessions].
- **FR-014**: System MUST log each proposal iteration count and stop after a threshold while prompting user for new constraints [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Max iteration threshold].
- **FR-015**: System MUST request explicit confirmation before creating or deleting any calendar event representing a significant time block (longer than threshold) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Threshold duration].
- **FR-016**: System MUST flag potential health/sleep conflicts when user requests changes that reduce sleep below a minimum target [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Default minimum sleep hours].
- **FR-017**: System MUST allow user to specify priorities (e.g., sleep, exercise, focus work) and reflect them in scheduling decisions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Priority input format].
- **FR-018**: System MUST persist user preference settings for priorities and constraints between sessions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Retention duration & deletion policy].
- **FR-019**: System MUST display a non-anthropomorphized AI visual (neutral avatar or waveform) without implying human identity.
- **FR-020**: System MUST differentiate clearly between current and proposed schedule using visual encoding (color, side-by-side, or labeling) without accessibility barriers [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Accessibility standards to meet].
- **FR-021**: System MUST provide a transcript export option (text) for user reference [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Format and retention].
- **FR-022**: System MUST obtain user consent before first syncing changes to Google Calendar referencing the scope of modifications.
- **FR-023**: System MUST recover gracefully from network loss by queueing unsynced approved proposals and prompting retry [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Retry strategy/backoff].
- **FR-024**: System MUST restrict actions to authenticated users [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Authentication mechanism].

*Ambiguity markers intentionally retained to signal areas needing stakeholder clarification prior to implementation planning.*
